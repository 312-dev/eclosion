# Cloudflare Pages redirects
#
# Static files are served automatically by Cloudflare Pages before these rules apply.
# These rules only match when no static file exists for the requested path.

# For missing /docs paths, show Docusaurus 404 page (not the React SPA)
/docs/* /404.html 404

# SPA fallback for all other routes (React app)
/* /index.html 200
