# Cloudflare Pages redirects
#
# IMPORTANT: This project does NOT include a 404.html file, which enables
# Cloudflare Pages' native SPA mode. Unknown paths automatically serve index.html.
# See: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/
#
# Static files (including /docs/* from Docusaurus) are served automatically.
# These rules only apply when no static file exists.

# No explicit rules needed - Cloudflare's native SPA mode handles everything.
# The React app's router handles 404s for unknown paths.
